# Attention Analysis: Fixed vs Vintage release dates

## Summary
- Hypothesis: Vintage release date alignment changes which timesteps receive attention
- Result: Moderate architectural impact - vintage models shift from distant-past anchoring to recency-focused attention
- Significant differences: Temporal variance (p=0.025, d=0.46) and attention strategy restructuring

## Key Findings

1. Vintage models learn a fundamentally different attention strategy
   - Fixed Release: Front-loaded attention (peak at t-20: 0.076, most distant past)
   - Vintage Release: Recency-biased attention (peak at t-1 to t-5: ~0.08, recent data)
   - Pattern shift: -0.043 attention at t-20, +0.008 to +0.013 at recent timesteps
   - Cosine similarity 0.973 is deceptive - measures angle similarity, not strategic differences

2. The attention shift is theoretically sound
   - At t-20, macroeconomic data is heavily forward-filled (stale) in vintage dataset
   - Fixed-release data has consistent freshness across all timesteps
   - Vintage models rationally learn to de-weight stale distant information
   - Emphasize fresh recent market data (VIX, yields always up-to-date)
   - This is appropriate adaptation to data characteristics

3. Vintage models show more temporal adaptation
   - Temporal variance: 0.00004 (Fixed) vs 0.00010 (Vintage), p=0.025*
   - Effect size: d=0.46 (small but significant)
   - Interpretation: Vintage attention shifts more across different market regimes
   - Models detect regime changes and adjust attention dynamically

4. Attention adaptation doesn't prevent collapse
   - Despite learning appropriate attention strategy for vintage data
   - Collapse rates remain similar between Fixed and Vintage phases
   - Directional accuracy, Sharpe ratios, prediction diversity all comparable
   - Critical insight: Attention mechanism adapts correctly, but output layer still fails

## Interpretation

Vintage release date alignment has moderate architectural impact on attention mechanisms:
- Successfully changes attention strategy to account for data staleness
- Models learn to prioritize information based on freshness (recency for vintage)
- Attention patterns are more adaptive across time periods

However despite this appropriate attention adaptation, collapse rates don't improve.

Key insight for phase 4+:
The attention mechanism is working correctly - it successfully adapts to different data characteristics. The problem is **downstream in the output layers**. This strengthens the case for:
- Output-layer modifications (regime-conditional outputs, distribution-aware regularization)
- Loss function changes that encode domain knowledge
- NOT attention mechanism modifications (attention already adapts appropriately)

The vintage comparison serves as a validation that TFT's attention can detect and respond to data quality differences, but translation to stable predictions requires architectural changes beyond attention.

| Metric | Fixed Release | Vintage Release | Difference | p-value | Cohen's d | Significant |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|------------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Avg Entropy | 2.90 ± 0.43 | 2.82 ± 0.14 | -0.08 (-2.7%) | 0.335 | -0.25 | No |

## Attention Pattern Details

### Mean Attention by Timestep

| Timestep | Fixed Release | Vintage Release | Difference |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| t-20 (most distant) | 0.076 | 0.034 | **-0.043** |
| t-19 | 0.050 | 0.036 | -0.014 |
| t-18 | 0.045 | 0.038 | -0.007 |
| t-10 (mid-range) | 0.043 | 0.045 | +0.002 |
| t-5 (recent) | 0.050 | 0.055 | +0.005 |
| t-3 | 0.053 | 0.064 | **+0.011** |
| t-2 | 0.056 | 0.069 | **+0.013** |
| t-1 (most recent) | 0.069 | 0.082 | **+0.013** |

Pattern interpretation:
- Fixed models anchor heavily on most distant past (t-20)
- Vintage models distribute attention more evenly with strong recency bias
- Peak attention shifts from t-20 → t-1 to t-5 window
- This reflects rational response to staleness in vintage macro data

### Cosine similarity: 0.973

Why high similarity despite different strategies?
- Cosine measures angle/direction, not magnitude distribution
- Both patterns show gradual increase toward recent timesteps (similar "shape")
- But the peak location and magnitude distribution changed substantially
- Cosine similarity can be misleading for attention pattern comparisons

Better metric: L2 distance = 0.053 (captures magnitude differences)

## Technical Notes

### Attention extraction
- Uses `model.interpret_output()` from pytorch-forecasting
- Extracts encoder attention weights (temporal fusion layer)
- Averages across batch dimension and attention heads
- Shape: `[batch, encoder_length]` → `[encoder_length]` (mean attention per timestep)

### Statistical tests
- Independent samples t-test for group comparisons
- Cohen's d for effect size (standardized mean difference)
  - d < 0.2: negligible
  - 0.2 ≤ d < 0.5: small
  - 0.5 ≤ d < 0.8: medium
  - d ≥ 0.8: large
- Significance threshold: p < 0.05

### Metrics computed

Entropy (attention diffusion):
- Formula: `-sum(p * log(p))` where p = attention weights (normalized)
- Range: 0 (completely focused) to log(encoder_length) (uniform)
- Typical values: 2.5-3.0 for encoder_length=20
- Higher = more diffuse, lower = more focused

Concentration (peakedness):
- Formula: `sum(top_3_weights)` 
- Range: 0-1 (1 = all attention on top 3 timesteps)
- Typical values: 0.04-0.08 for diffuse attention

Temporal Variance:
- Variance of attention patterns across different time periods
- Measures how much attention strategy changes over time
- Higher = more adaptive to regime changes

Recency Bias:
- Mean attention weight on most recent 5 timesteps (t-1 to t-5)
- Range: 0-1
- Higher = stronger focus on recent data

### Pattern comparison

Cosine Similarity:
- Measures angle between attention vectors
- Range: -1 (opposite) to 1 (identical)
- Values > 0.95 typically considered "very similar"
- Limitation: Doesn't capture magnitude distribution changes

L2 Distance (Euclidean):
- Measures magnitude difference between patterns
- Range: 0 (identical) to ~1.4 (maximum for normalized vectors)
- More sensitive to distribution changes than cosine
- Values < 0.1 suggest similar patterns

## Implications for phase 4+ architecture

### What this analysis tells us

1. Attention mechanism is not the bottlenec
   - TFT attention successfully adapts to data characteristics
   - Responds appropriately to staleness cues in vintage data
   - Detects and shifts with market regime changes
   - Conclusion: Don't modify attention mechanism

2. Focus on output layer modifications
   - Attention detects regimes but predictions still collapse
   - Output layer cannot translate attention insights into stable forecasts
   - Priority targets:
     - Regime-conditional output transformations
     - Distribution-aware loss functions
     - Output regularization that encodes financial domain knowledge

3. Staleness information is being used
   - Vintage models implicitly detect staleness (de-weight t-20)
   - Don't need explicit staleness features as inputs
   - Can encode staleness through data alignment choices
   - Recommendation: Use vintage alignment + output modifications, not staleness features

4. Temporal adaptation is preserved
   - Both model types show regime-aware attention shifts
   - Vintage models are more adaptive (higher temporal variance)
   - This adaptability should be maintained in Phase 3+ modifications

### Recommended Phase 3+ Approaches

Based on this analysis:

Promising directions:
- Regime-conditional output layers that adapt to attention entropy
- Mixed-frequency attention with explicit staleness penalties
- Loss functions with temporal consistency regularization
- Multi-task learning (predict constituents + index)

Less promising:
- Modifying base attention mechanism (already works well)
- Adding raw staleness features as inputs (causes collapse in Phase 1)
- Removing temporal adaptation (models benefit from it)

## Caveats and Limitations

1. Encoder length filtering
   - Pattern comparison only includes experiments with encoder_length=20
   - Phase 0 had experiments with varying encoder lengths (10-60)
   - May not capture full diversity of Phase 0 attention strategies

2. Temporal aggregation
   - Analysis uses yearly groupings (2020-2025)
   - May mask shorter-term attention dynamics
   - Models might shift attention more frequently than captured

3. Statistical power
   - Phase 2b has fewer experiments (30) than Phase 0 (57)
   - Some true differences may not reach significance
   - Effect sizes should be considered alongside p-values

4. Cosine similarity interpretation
   - High cosine similarity (0.973) is somewhat misleading
   - Masks important changes in magnitude distribution
   - L2 distance and visual inspection more informative

5. Causality
   - Analysis shows association, not causation
   - Cannot prove vintage alignment *causes* attention shift
   - Could be confounded by hyperparameter differences

6. Generalization
   - Findings specific to TFT architecture
   - May not apply to other attention mechanisms
   - Results depend on S&P 500 data characteristics
